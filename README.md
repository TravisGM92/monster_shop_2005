[Monster Shop Project](https://immense-mesa-61866.herokuapp.com/)
<br>
Keep in mind this project was about backend development and minimal frontend development. One can;
1. Register as a new user
2. Login/logout
3. Create items to sell through a merchant
4. If one is an admin, they can view all orders, view all items, view all users.

This project was a group collaboration project between myself, Corey Carter, Saryn Mooney and Judith Pillado. The project requirements were;
1. Create an app that is able to be viewed on Heroku.
2. Create functionaltiy of the following; (allow a visitor to register as a new user, if a visitor is an admin, allow them to see all merchants in the program, all the visitor to register as a merchant and as such create items they would like to sell, if a visitor is an admin, allow them to see all users in the system (but that functionality is ONLY for the admin), etc.)
3. Implement minimal CSS/HTML in order for the app to have pages one can view on Heroku.
